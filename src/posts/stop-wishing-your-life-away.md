Don't focus on the end goal, because really there is no end goal, the journey is the adventure and how you get to the final outcome is the fun. Make memories as you work towards your goal, don't make the goal itself more important.\
\
Because life is short, and when you look back and you finally take a step away for a moment and see the journey in its bigger form, in a wider view, then you see that ultimately you had more fun getting where you are than being where you are. Now you're there you won't be filled with content, you will be thinking about the next project. And so the cycle starts over. 

Treat every day, every minute, every second, as important as the goal itself. You cannot buy time, so don't squander it.\
\
Don't wish your life away while working to an ideal outcome, because you're wasting time, the getting there is where the real fun is to be had.
