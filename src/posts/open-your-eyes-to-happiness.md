We are at war with ourselves, a lot of us, most of us have probably experienced it, you are feeling like something is missing.  

One interpretation of this would be the desire to live in a place which you are not, whether it be a different country, or even some magical dream world in which you are floating through the air, you do not feel content and that is a problem. You can never be content, there will always be something you wish you had that you don't already have, you may feel like you can't be truly happy until you live in this place or you have this item, or whatever it may be.  

And you're going to become depressed about it, it's going to consume you and be your every thought. Sometimes it can be spun in a good way, like a goal, something to look forward to. And if that's what works for you then that's wonderful. But you've achieved your goals, what then? You are endlessly setting goals and you're not living in the moment. You're wasting time getting to the goal, and everything else in-between is some kind of blurry haze.  

Why are you doing this to yourself, you'll never be truly happy, you need to slow down, calm your mind and see the bigger picture.

Say you move to this place and it's all you ever thought it would be, and then some years later you realise oh maybe this isn't as good as I'd pictured it, there are some real big problems here. When the magic wears off and you become used to where you are, you'll then think oh well now I've been here and you know what I'm kind of tired of this now, I want something new, and so this circle continues. 



It's like the saying, the grass is always greener on the other side. And you'll be forever looking at greener grass every time.  

You can go ahead and try it, don't let me stop you. But it's likely not the solution you think it might be.  

If you can let go of this idea that happiness is a place or object then you can see what happiness lies around you, you need to open your eyes to what you already have, and realise that true happiness comes from within.
