You can call me Kida ðŸ‘‹

I write about my perspective on this weird existence. And I try to make people question everything, and show that living should not be so serious. Nothing really matters, so be the best person you can be, and live a happy life. We are after all just organisms drifting along a universe that is much bigger than us. Our one purpose is to exist.
